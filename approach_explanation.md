# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview
Our solution implements a multi-layered document analysis system that extracts and ranks document sections based on persona-specific relevance using semantic understanding and keyword matching.

## Architecture & Methodology

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Utilizes PyPDF2 for reliable page-by-page text extraction
- **Section Identification**: Employs regex patterns to detect document structure (headers, subsections)
- **Content Normalization**: Cleans and preprocesses text for better analysis

### 2. Intelligent Section Detection
We use enhanced pattern recognition to identify document sections:
- Numbered sections (1., 2.1, etc.)
- Title case headers
- ALL CAPS sections
- Colon-terminated titles
- Roman numeral sections

This approach doesn't rely on font formatting, making it robust across different PDF types.

### 3. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
Our hybrid scoring combines multiple signals:

**Semantic Similarity (50% weight)**:
- Uses SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for contextual understanding
- Compares section content against persona + job-to-be-done context
- Captures nuanced semantic relationships

**Keyword Matching (30% weight)**:
- Extracts key terms from persona and job descriptions
- Counts relevant keyword occurrences in content
- Provides direct topic alignment

**Content Quality Factors (20% weight)**:
- Length scoring (prefers substantial content)
- Title relevance boost
- Section completeness validation

### 4. Sub-section Analysis
- Sentence-level relevance scoring within top sections
- Intelligent text refinement and summarization
- Maintains context while improving readability

## Technical Optimizations

### Performance
- **Model Selection**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~23MB) balances accuracy with size constraints
- **Efficient Processing**: Vectorized similarity computations
- **Smart Filtering**: Early elimination of irrelevant content

### Robustness
- **Multi-domain Compatibility**: Generic patterns work across academic, business, and technical documents
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
- **Encoding Support**: UTF-8 handling for international content

### Offline Operation
- Pre-downloads all models during Docker build
- No network dependencies during execution
- Local NLTK data installation

## Output Structure
The system produces structured JSON with:
- **Metadata**: Processing context and timestamps
- **Extracted Sections**: Top relevant sections with importance ranking
- **Sub-section Analysis**: Refined text snippets with enhanced readability

This approach ensures high relevance matching while maintaining computational efficiency within the specified constraints (≤60 seconds, ≤1GB model size, CPU-only execution).
