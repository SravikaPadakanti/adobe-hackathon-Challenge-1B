# Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a multi-stage document intelligence pipeline that combines traditional NLP techniques with machine learning to extract and rank document sections based on persona-specific requirements.

## Core Architecture

### 1. PDF Processing and Structure Recognition
We use PyMuPDF for robust text extraction, implementing intelligent heading detection through font property analysis. The system identifies potential headings by examining font sizes, bold formatting, and textual patterns, maintaining document structure with precise page-level granularity.

### 2. Content Preprocessing and Normalization  
Text preprocessing employs NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and Porter stemming. This standardization ensures consistent feature extraction across diverse document types while preserving semantic meaning through careful normalization strategies.

### 3. Semantic Relevance Scoring
The relevance engine utilizes TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity to measure semantic alignment between document sections and the combined persona+job query. We employ both unigram and bigram features to capture contextual relationships, with feature space limited to 1000 dimensions for performance optimization.

### 4. Section Ranking and Analysis
Sections are ranked by relevance scores using a hybrid approach that considers both semantic similarity and structural importance. The system extracts refined subsections by identifying key sentences through sentence-level analysis, providing condensed yet comprehensive content summaries.

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient vectorization**: Limited feature space prevents memory overflow
- **Batch processing**: Simultaneous document processing maximizes CPU utilization  
- **Early termination**: Smart stopping conditions prevent infinite processing loops
- **Memory management**: Explicit cleanup and lightweight model selection

### Constraint Compliance
The solution operates entirely on CPU using lightweight models (scikit-learn, NLTK) totaling under 50MB. Processing time scales linearly with document count, optimized to handle 3-10 documents within the 60-second constraint through algorithmic efficiency rather than hardware acceleration.

### Error Handling and Robustness
Comprehensive error recovery ensures system reliability across diverse PDF formats. The system gracefully handles corrupted files, missing headings, and complex document structures through fallback mechanisms and detailed logging.

## Windows Integration
Full PowerShell integration enables seamless Windows development with automated setup, testing, and validation scripts. The Docker implementation maintains cross-platform compatibility while supporting local Windows development workflows.

This approach balances accuracy, performance, and reliability within the specified constraints, delivering a production-ready document intelligence system suitable for diverse persona-driven analysis scenarios.
